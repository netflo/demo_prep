use built in script:

on the machine with your ID  (for example from a    ssh-keygen  -t rsa -b 4096 )
ssh-copy-id username@remote_host   (where you want key auth)

this will copy across your pub key 
if you can then login without a password issuing a:  ssh username@remote_host,   then it is working
and you could/ought to switch off  the password based auth if you know what you are doing with:   
     PasswordAuthentication no     into   /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo systemctl restart ssh     will complete the removal of pass auth.
